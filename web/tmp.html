</table>
<p><strong><em>Draconic Ancestry</em></strong>. You have draconic
ancestry. Choose one type of dragon from the Draconic Ancestry table.
Your breath weapon and damage resistance are determined by the dragon
type, as shown in the table.</p>
<p><strong><em>Breath Weapon</em></strong>. You can use your action to
exhale destructive energy. Your draconic ancestry determines the size,
shape, and damage type of the exhalation.</p>
<p>When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the
exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by
your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your
Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6
damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one.
The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at
16th level.</p>
<p>After you use your breath weapon, you can’t use it again until you
complete a short or long rest.</p>
<p><strong><em>Damage Resistance</em></strong>. You have resistance to
the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.</p>
<p><strong><em>Ieithoedd</em></strong>. You can speak, read, and write
Common and Draconic. Draconic is thought to be one of the oldest
languages and is often used in the study of magic. The language sounds
harsh to most other creatures and includes numerous hard consonants and
sibilants.</p>

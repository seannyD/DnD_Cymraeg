Slick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a point within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the duration.

When the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (cais achub Chwimder) or fall prone (llorio). A creature that enters the area or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (cais achub Chwimder) or fall prone (llorio).

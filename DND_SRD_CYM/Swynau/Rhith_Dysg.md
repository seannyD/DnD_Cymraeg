You create an lledrith of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The lledrith is imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the spell how the lledrith behaves and what sounds it makes. This scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.

When the condition you specify occurs, the lledrith springs into existence and performs in the manner you described. Once the lledrith finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for 10 minutes. After this time, the lledrith can be activated again.

The triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an lledrith of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to open a trapped door, or you could set the lledrith to trigger only when a creature says the correct word or phrase.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an lledrith, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an lledrith with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the lledrith for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

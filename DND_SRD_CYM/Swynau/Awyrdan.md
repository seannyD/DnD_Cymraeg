A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you specify. Each creature in a 10-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw (cais achub Chwimder). A creature takes 4d6 fire damage (difrod tân) and 4d6 radiant damage (difrod pelydrol) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Ar lefelau uwch:***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the fire damage (difrod tân) or the radiant damage (difrod pelydrol) (your choice) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.

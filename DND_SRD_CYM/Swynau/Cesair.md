A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot radius, 40-foot high cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must make a Dexterity saving throw (cais achub Chwimder). A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage (difrod taro) and 4d6 cold damage (difrod oer) on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

Hailstones turn the storm's area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your next turn.

***Ar lefelau uwch:***. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage (difrod taro) increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.

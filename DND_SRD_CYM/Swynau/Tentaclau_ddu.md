Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.

When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (cais achub Chwimder) or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage (difrod taro) and be restrained (cyfyngu) by the tentacles until the spell ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained (cyfyngu) by the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage (difrod taro).

A creature restrained (cyfyngu) by the tentacles can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.

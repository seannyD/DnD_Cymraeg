# Hunanrhith (Project Image)

*Lefel 7 lledrith*

**Amser Hudo:** 1 acsiwn

**Amrediad:** 500 millturoedd

**Cydrannau:** G, S, M (a small replica of you made from materials worth at least 5 gp)

**Parhad:** Canolbwyntio, hyd at 1 day

You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless of intervening obstacles. The lledrith looks and sounds like you but is intangible. If the lledrith takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends.

You can use your action to move this lledrith up to twice your speed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.

You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded (dall) and deafened (byddaru) in regard to your own surroundings.

Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an lledrith, because things can pass through it. A

creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an lledrith with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the lledrith for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.

You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range. The target must make a Constitution saving throw (cais achub Cyfansoddiad). On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage (difrod necrotig), or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced am un awr by an amount equal to the necrotic damage (difrod necrotig) it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes.

A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot wide, 60-foot long line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw (cais achub Cyfansoddiad). On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage (difrod pelydrol) and is blinded (dall) until your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded (dall) by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

You can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.

For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.

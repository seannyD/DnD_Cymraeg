# Tyfu Pigion (Spike Growth)

*Lefel 2 treiglio*

**Amser Hudo:** 1 action

**Amrediad:** 150 troedfedd

**Cydrannau:** G, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)

**Parhad:** Canolbwyntio, hyd at 10  munud

The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage (difrod tyllu) for every 5 feet it travels.

The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any creature that can't see the area at the time the spell is cast must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.

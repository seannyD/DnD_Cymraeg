You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a 30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw (cais achub Doethder). On a failed save, the creature becomes charmed (swyno) for the duration. While charmed (swyno) by this spell, the creature is incapacitated (diallu) and has a speed of 0.

The spell ends for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action to shake the creature out of its stupor.

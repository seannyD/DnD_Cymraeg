Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw (cais achub Cyfansoddiad). On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage (difrod pelydrol) and is blinded (dall) am un munud. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn't blinded (dall) by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw.

A creature blinded (dall) by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw (cais achub Cyfansoddiad) at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded (dall).

This spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a spell.

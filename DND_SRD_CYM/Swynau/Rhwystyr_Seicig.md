Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to psychic damage (difrod seicic), any effect that would sense its emotions or read its thoughts, dewindabaeth spells, and the charmed (swyno) condition. The spell even foils *wish* spells and spells or effects of similar power used to affect the target's mind or to gain information about the target.

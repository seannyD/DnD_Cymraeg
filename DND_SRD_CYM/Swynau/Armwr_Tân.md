Thin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.

The flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you choose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage (difrod oer), and the chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage (difrod tân).

In addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with a melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8 fire damage (difrod tân) from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage (difrod oer) from a cold shield.

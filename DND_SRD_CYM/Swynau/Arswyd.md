Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw (cais achub Doethder). On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened (ofnus) for the duration. The lledrith calls on the creature's deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened (ofnus) creature's turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (cais achub Doethder) or take 4d10 psychic damage (difrod seicic). On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.

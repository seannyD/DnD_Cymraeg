***Amorphous***. The ooze can move through a space as narrow as 1 inch wide without squeezing.

***Corrode Metal***. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal that hits the ooze corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to -5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal that hits the ooze is destroyed after dealing damage.

The ooze can eat through 2-inch-thick, nonmagical metal in 1 round.

***False Appearance***. While the ooze remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from an oily pool or wet rock.

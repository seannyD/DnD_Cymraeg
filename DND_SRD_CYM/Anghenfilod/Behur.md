###### Acsiwn

***Amlymosod***. The behir makes two attacks: one with its bite and one to constrict.

***Brathu***. *Ymosodiad Arf Sgarmes* +10 i fwrw, cyrraedd 10 tr., un targed. *Taro:* 22 (3d10+6) difrod tyllu.

***Constrict***. *Ymosodiad Arf Sgarmes* +10 i fwrw, cyrraedd 5 tr., one Large or smaller creature. *Taro:* 17 (2d10+6) difrod taro ac 17 (2d10+6) difrod slasio. The target is grappled (gafael) (escape DC 16) if the behir isn't already constricting a creature, and the target is restrained (cyfyngu) until this grapple ends.

***Lightning Breath (Recharge 5-6)***. The behir exhales a line of lightning (mellt) that is 20 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line llwyddo ar cais achub Chwimder DC 16, taking 66 (12d10) lightning (mellt) damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Swallow***. The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded (dall) and restrained (cyfyngu), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid (asid) damage at the start of each of the behir's turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.

If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir llwyddo ar cais achub Cyfansoddiad DC 14 at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone (llorio) in a space within 10 feet of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained (cyfyngu) by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 feet of movement, exiting prone (llorio).

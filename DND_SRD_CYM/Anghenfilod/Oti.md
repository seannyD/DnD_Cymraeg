***Limited Telepathy***. The otyugh can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 feet of it that can understand a language. This form of telepathy doesn't allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond.

###### Acsiwn

***Amlymosod***. The otyugh makes three attacks: one with its bite and two with its tentacles.

***Brathu***. *Ymosodiad Arf Sgarmes* +6 i fwrw, cyrraedd 5 tr., un targed. *Taro:* 12 (2d8+3) difrod tyllu. If the target is a creature, it llwyddo ar cais achub Cyfansoddiad DC 15 against disease or become poison (gwenwyn)ed (gwenwyno) until the disease is cured. Every 24 hours that elapse, the target must repeat the saving throw, reducing its hit point maximum by 5 (1d10) on a failure. The disease is cured on a success. The target dies if the disease reduces its hit point maximum to 0. This reduction to the target's hit point maximum lasts until the disease is cured.

***Tentacle***. *Ymosodiad Arf Sgarmes* +6 i fwrw, cyrraedd 10 tr., un targed. *Taro:* 7 (1d8+3) difrod taro ac 4 (1d8) difrod tyllu. If the target is Medium or smaller, it is grappled (gafael) (escape DC 13) and restrained (cyfyngu) until the grapple ends. The otyugh has two tentacles, each of which can grapple un targed.

***Tentacle Slam***. The otyugh slams creatures grappled (gafael) by it into each other or a solid surface. Each creature llwyddo ar cais achub Cyfansoddiad DC 14 or take 10 (2d6+3) bludgeoning (taro) damage and be stunned (syfrdan) until the end of the otyugh's next turn. On a successful save, the target takes half the bludgeoning (taro) damage and isn't stunned (syfrdan).

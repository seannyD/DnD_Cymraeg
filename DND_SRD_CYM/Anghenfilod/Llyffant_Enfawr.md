###### Acsiwn

***Brathu***. *Ymosodiad Arf Sgarmes* +4 i fwrw, cyrraedd 5 tr., un targed. *Taro:* 7 (1d10+2) difrod tyllu ac 5 (1d10) difrod gwenwyn, ac mae'r targed wedi ei afael (DC dianc 13). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained (cyfyngu), and the toad can't bite another target.

***Swallow***. The toad makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is blinded (dall) and restrained (cyfyngu), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the toad, and it takes 10 (3d6) acid (asid) damage at the start of each of the toad's turns. The toad can have only one target swallowed at a time.

If the toad dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained (cyfyngu) by it and can escape from the corpse using 5 feet of movement, exiting prone (llorio).

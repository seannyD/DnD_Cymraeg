# Carreg Gorchmynnu Elementydd Pridd (Stone of Controlling Earth Elementals)

*Eitem Rhyfeddol, prin*

If the stone is touching the ground, you can use an action to speak its command word and summon an earth elemental, as if you had cast the *conjure elemental* (*aswyno elementydd*) spell. The stone can't be used this way again until the next dawn. The stone weighs 5 pounds.

# Lens Swyno (Eyes of Charming)

*Eitem Rhyfeddol, anarferol (angen ymdiwnio)*

These crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the *charm person* (*swyno person*) spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.

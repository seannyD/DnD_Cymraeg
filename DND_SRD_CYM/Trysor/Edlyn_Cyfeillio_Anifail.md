# Edlyn Cyfeillio Anifail (Potion of Animal Friendship)

*Edlyn, anarferol*

When you drink this potion, you can cast the *animal friendship* (*cyfeillio anifail*) spell (save DC 13) am un awr at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.

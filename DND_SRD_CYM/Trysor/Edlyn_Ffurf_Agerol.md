# Edlyn Ffurf Agerol (Potion of Gaseous Form)

*Edlyn, prin*

When you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the *gaseous form* (*ffurf cwmwl*) spell am un awr (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potion's container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.

# Crochan Gorchmynnu Elementydd Dŵr (Brazier of Commanding Fire Elementals)

*Eitem Rhyfeddol, prin*

While a fire (tân) burns in this brass brazier, you can use an action to speak the brazier's command word and summon a fire (tân) elemental, as if you had cast the *conjure elemental* (*aswyno elementydd*) spell. The brazier can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

The brazier weighs 5 pounds.

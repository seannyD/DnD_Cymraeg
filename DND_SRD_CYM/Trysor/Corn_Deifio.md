You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunder (taran)ous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone llwyddo ar cais achub Cyfansoddiad DC 15. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder (taran) damage and is deafened am un munud. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder (taran) damage instead of 5d6.

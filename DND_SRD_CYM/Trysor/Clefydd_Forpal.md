# Clefydd Forpal (Vorpal Sword)

*Arf (unrhyw clefydd sy'n delio difrod slasio), chwedleuol (angen ymdiwnio)*

You gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, the weapon ignores resistance to slashing (slasio) damage.

When you attack a creature that has at least one head with this weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, you cut off one of the creature's heads. The creature dies if it can't survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing (slasio) damage, doesn't have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing (slasio) damage from the hit.

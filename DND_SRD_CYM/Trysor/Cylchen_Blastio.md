# Cylchen Blastio (Circlet of Blasting)

*Eitem Rhyfeddol, anarferol*

While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the *scorching ray* (*peledr tân*) spell with it. When you make the spell's attacks, you do so with an attack bonus of +5. The circlet can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

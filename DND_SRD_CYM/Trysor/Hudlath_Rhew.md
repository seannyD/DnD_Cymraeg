# Hudlath Rhew (Staff of Frost)

*Hudlath, prin iawn (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

You have resistance to cold (oer) damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: *cone of cold (oer)* (*c√¥n oer*) (5 charges), *fog cloud* (*niwl*) (1 charge), *ice storm* (*cesair*) (4 charges), or *wall of ice* (*rhewfur*) (4 charges).

The staff regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff turns to water and is destroyed.

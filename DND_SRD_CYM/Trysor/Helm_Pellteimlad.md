# Helm Pellteimlad (Helm of Telepathy)

*Eitem Rhyfeddol, anarferol (angen ymdiwnio)*

While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the *detect thoughts* (*synhwyro meddyliau*) spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply-using a bonus action to do so-while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with *detect thoughts* (*synhwyro meddyliau*), you can use an action to cast the *suggestion* (*awgrym*) spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the *suggestion* (*awgrym*) property can't be used again until the next dawn.

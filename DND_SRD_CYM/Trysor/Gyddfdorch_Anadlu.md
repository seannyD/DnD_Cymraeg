# Gyddfdorch Anadlu (Necklace of Adaptation)

*Eitem Rhyfeddol, anarferol (angen ymdiwnio)*

While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as *cloudkill* (*cwmwl gwenwyn*) and *stinking cloud* (*cwmwl drewllyd*) effects, inhaled poison (gwenwyn)s, and the breath weapons of some dragons).

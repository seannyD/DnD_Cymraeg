# Saeth Adladdu (Arrow of Slaying)

*Arf (saeth), prin iawn*

An *arrow of slaying* is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both *arrows of dragon slaying* and *arrows of blue dragon slaying*. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an *arrow of slaying* takes damage from the arrow, the creature llwyddo ar cais achub Cyfansoddiad DC 17, taking an extra 6d10 piercing (tyllu) damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once an *arrow of slaying* deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.

Other types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as *bolts of slaying* meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most arferol.

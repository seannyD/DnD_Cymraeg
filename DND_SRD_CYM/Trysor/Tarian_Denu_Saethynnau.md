# Tarian Denu Saethynnau (Shield of Missile Attraction)

*Armwr (taran), prin (angen ymdiwnio)*

While holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.

***Curse***. This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the *remove curse* (*dadfelltithio*) spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.

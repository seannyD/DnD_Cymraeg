# Gyddfdorch Pelau Tân (Necklace of Fireballs)

*Eitem Rhyfeddol, prin*

This necklace has 1d6+3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level *fire (tân)ball* (*llosgbel*) spell (save DC 15).

You can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the *fire (tân)ball* (*llosgbel*) by 1 for each bead beyond the first.

# Pelen Crisial (Crystal Ball)

*Eitem Rhyfeddol, prin iawn or chwedleuol (angen ymdiwnio)*

The typical *crystal ball*, a prin iawn item, is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the *scrying* (*ysbio*) spell (save DC 17) with it.

The following *crystal ball* variants are chwedleuol items and have additional properties.

***Crystal Ball of Mind Reading***. You can use an action to cast the *detect thoughts* (*synhwyro meddyliau*) spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the *crystal ball*, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this *detect thoughts* (*synhwyro meddyliau*) to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying* (*ysbio*) ends.

***Crystal Ball of Telepathy***. While scrying with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the *suggestion* (*awgrym*) spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this *suggestion* (*awgrym*) to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if *scrying* (*ysbio*) ends. Once used, the *suggestion* (*awgrym*) power of the *crystal ball* can't be used again until the next dawn.

***Crystal Ball of True Seeing***. While scrying with the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell's sensor.

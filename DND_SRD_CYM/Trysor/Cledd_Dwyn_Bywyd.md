*Arf (unrhyw clefydd), prin iawn (angen ymdiwnio)*

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The sword has 1d8+1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it llwyddo ar cais achub Cyfansoddiad DC 15 or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force (grym) from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.
